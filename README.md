Removes Gmail content from header when printing an email.

  [via Developer Mode]

On the rare occasion that I need to print an email, I always find myself  
removing the Gmail header elements through Chrome's Developer Tools.

This simple extension automates that process, so you can get back to
browsing Reddit or whatever.
